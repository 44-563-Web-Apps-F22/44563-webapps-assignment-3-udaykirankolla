                <h2>  AravindhaSametha Movie </h2>

                <P>A 30-year-long war between two rival faction groups from two villages in Kadapa—Kommaddi led by <b>Narappa Reddy</b>, and Nallagudi led by Basi Reddy.
                I like the movie because the tarak acts a major role this movie to change the un educated peoples mind.And so This is the story of movie below.
                <i>The war has been affecting the lives of people from both the gangs. Narappa Reddy's son Veera Raghava Reddy, who was in London for 12 years, returns to the village.
                On his way home, he ends up losing Narappa Reddy in an attack by Basi Reddy and his men, following which he undergoes a violent transformation and murders Basi Reddy's gangsters and stabs the latter himself.
                which makes everyone believes he has been murdered.</i>
                Upon realizing that violence might not be the ultimate solution, Veera Raghava leaves for Hyderabad, hoping that the fights will reduce as the opposition will not have anyone to fight.
                He befriends a mechanic Neelambari, and circumstances force him into living with two women, Aravinda and Sunanda's family. Aravinda influences his beliefs and thoughts and falls for Veera Raghava. 
                Meanwhile, Basi Reddy is found alive, and orders his gang, headed by his son Bala Reddy to find and capture Veera Raghava.</P>
